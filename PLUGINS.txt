This file tracks changes made in the plugins branch. It was started after the
work was well under way, so the early changes aren't exhaustive.



Command line parsing is all done by optparse, removing the use of getopt. This
makes the help messages more consistent but makes the usage messages less
useful in some situations.

unit2 runs test discovery if invoked without any arguments.

unit2 can execute tests in filenames as well as module names - so long as the
module pointed to by the filename is importable from the current directory.



TODO: 

messaging API that respects verbosity
allow options, like verbosity, to be specified in the config file
TestFailEvent in setUpClass and setUpModule etc
a command line option to specify a config file location
running test discovery by default if no arguments are supplied
if a *filename* rather than a module name is provided then attempt to execute
it. Include firing the HandleFile event to give an opportunity for plugins to
work on it.
unit2 -h should mention the discover subcommand.
