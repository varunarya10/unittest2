This file tracks changes made in the plugins branch. It was started after the
work was well under way, so the early changes aren't exhaustive.


TestLoader has a new attribute ``DEFAULT_PATTERN``. This is so that the
regex matching plugin can change the default pattern used for test discovery
when no pattern is explicitly provided.

Command line parsing is all done by optparse, removing the use of getopt. This
makes the help messages more consistent but makes the usage messages less
useful in some situations.

unit2 runs test discovery if invoked without any arguments.

unit2 can execute tests in filenames as well as module names - so long as the
module pointed to by the filename is importable from the current directory.

FunctionTestCase.id() returns 'module.funcname' instead of just funcname.

Added util.formatTraceback, the default way of formatting tracebacks. TestCase
has a new formatTraceback method (delegating to util.formatTraceback). TestCase
instances can implement formatTraceback to control how the traceback for errors
and failures are represented.


TODO:

Certain event attributes should be read only (like extraTests, extraNames etc)

Plugin.register and Plugin.unregister aren't precisely complementary.

Add an epilogue to the optparse help messages.

The discovery command line interface has changed a lot and the tests need
reviewing to ensure they still provide full coverage.

messaging API that respects verbosity

allow options, like verbosity, to be specified in the config file

TestFailEvent in setUpClass and setUpModule etc
